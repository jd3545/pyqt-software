This software is designed for labeling images for training a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, specifically for the game 8-ball pool. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

User Interface (UI):
The software provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt (or PySide) for interaction.
It consists of various widgets such as labels, buttons, and frames arranged in a layout to organize the elements.
Main Features:
Image Display: The GUI displays images from the 8-ball pool game. These images likely contain scenes or frames from the game.
Labeling: Users can manually label specific elements in the images, presumably 8-ball cue balls, using the provided interface elements.
Navigation: Users can navigate between different images using navigation buttons like "[PREVIOUS]" and "[NEXT]".
Loading Data: There are buttons for loading classes and images, suggesting the software can load pre-existing data related to classes (possibly labels or categories) and image datasets.
Status Display: The GUI includes a status display area where the current status or progress of the labeling process is shown.
Underlying Functionality:
Backend Connection: The GUI is connected to a backend module (backend_connection.py) to handle interactions and processing logic.
Data Management: The software likely manages data related to images, labels, and classes internally.
Integration with YOLO: The labeled data generated using this tool can be used to train a YOLO model for object detection specifically tailored to detecting elements within the 8-ball pool game.
Overall, this software serves as a tool to facilitate the process of labeling images for training an object detection model, with a focus on the game 8-ball pool, by providing an intuitive interface for users to label game elements within the images.





Threading (can implement):


We will utilize the QThread class in PyQt5.
Threading is necessary for moving heavy or blocking operations off the main thread to keep the GUI responsive.
We'll move the image processing operations, such as DETECT_CUE_BALL and UPDATE_LABELED_IMG, into a separate thread.
---
Threading is introduced using the QThread class and QThreadPool.
Heavy operations like image processing and UI updates are placed within threaded functions.
Threading prevents blocking the main GUI thread, ensuring responsiveness.
